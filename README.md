## Docs

This module is a browser plugin for [DalekJS](//github.com/dalekjs/dalek).
It provides all a WebDriverServer & browser launcher for Mozilla Firefox.

The browser plugin can be installed with the following command:

```
$ npm install dalek-browser-firefox --save-dev
```

You can use the browser plugin by adding a config option to the your Dalekfile

```js
"browsers": ["firefox"]
```

Or you can tell Dalek that it should test in this browser via the command line:

```
$ dalek mytest.js -b firefox
```

Because of the availability of the Firefox Marionette testing framework,
Dalek atm. can only drive the Firefox Aurora Debug builds.

You also have to add the location of the browser executable to you Dalekfile,
because Dalek isn't capable of finding the executable yet on its own.

```js
  "browsers": [{
    "firefox": {
      "path": "~/Apps/FirefoxAuroraDebug.app/"
    }
  }]
```

The Firefox plugin only implements a subset of Daleks Assertions & Actions, so if you run into any bugs, the issue is most probably related to missing commands.
